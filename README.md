HealthIntellect – Medical NLP Analytics Suite

HealthIntellect is an AI-driven Medical NLP analytics suite designed to extract, analyze, and interpret healthcare data using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Knowledge Graphs.
It transforms raw medical text into structured insights, helping in faster diagnosis, clinical decision support, and healthcare data intelligence.

🚀 Key Features

✔ Medical Text Processing

Extracts symptoms, diseases, medicines, and tests from clinical notes.

Handles prescriptions, EMR records, reports, and health documents.

✔ Advanced NLP Pipeline

Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Relation Extraction

Text Summarization

Medical Question-Answering

Contextual embeddings using BioBERT / ClinicalBERT

✔ Knowledge Graph Intelligence

Builds Neo4j-based medical knowledge graphs

Links symptoms → diseases → drugs → tests

Supports structured and graph queries

✔ Predictive Analytics

Disease risk prediction

Classification models for early diagnosis

Pattern and anomaly detection in patient data

✔ Smart Dashboard

Visual analytics to explore medical patterns

Relationship graphs and trend analysis

User-friendly UI for healthcare insights

✔ REST API Integration

FastAPI/Flask-based API endpoints

Integrate with EMR systems, apps, and hospitals easily
